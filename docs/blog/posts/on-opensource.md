# The Relationship Between Mehal and Ubiquitous Factory

## TLDR
Mehal Technologies takes snapshots of the Ubiquitous Factory projects and distributes them under a different license under a commercial support and services agreement.

## Introduction

Since the early 2010s Open Source Software has been used by certain parts of the industry to drive global adoption. 

This adoption led approach was encouraged by a business community that had seen social platforms succeed by gaining significant user bases and then working out the monitisation strategy after the fact. 

Unfortunately, In software this strategy failed to meet expectations as the steps social platforms could take post user acquisition, such as focusing on advertising didn't make sense in the smaller technology ecosystem. 

This has now led to a plethora of once open source companies converting to commercial licenses for their software and has proven the point that Open Source is not a sustainable business model.

## How is Ubiquitous Factory different? 

Fundamentally Ubiquitous Factory operates it's open source projects as a collaboration model rather than a commercial model.

From our perspective open source is a way to deliver value in a market that is fundamentally shifting how it expects to use integrated software and professional services solutions. 

This isn't just our view: 

SaaS companies have started to use the term [Service as a Software](https://www.theclueless.company/what-is-service-as-a-software/) or [Saas 2.0](https://medium.com/formaloo/saas-2-0-fc4d3ec2a76f) to articulate this change 

Professional Service companies such as Delloite have started to use the term [operate](https://www.deloitte.com/global/en/what-we-do/capabilities/operate.html) to reflect this shift.

AWS are guiding [Managed Service Providers](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/the-business-case-for-next-generation-aws-managed-service-providers-msps/) to move up the value chain into a similar model as well.

## What does that mean in practice? 

It means that Mehal Technologies use their own distributions of these projects in their engagements and where it makes sense we will be contributing changes back upstream. We are not going to drive our adoption through developer downloads but work with businesses that are struggling to realise the benefits of the changes that are happening in technology and provide them with safe and robust solutions that meet customer needs.
