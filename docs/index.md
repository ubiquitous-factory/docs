# Welcome to the Ubiquitous Factory!! 

Ubiquitous Factory is a set of open source projects sponsored by [Mehal Technologies](https://mehal.tech/) designed to support edge compute scenarios.

The projects focus on the intersection of operating system, application and AI management for small form factor devices.

The aim is to build out tools and reference architectures that can be modified and deployed in relevant scenarios.

Mehal Technologies offers supported builds of these components and offers SaaS services around them.
